# Minesweeper

This is a Java implementation of minesweeper with a graphical user interface. Standard minesweeper rules apply and statistics are recorded. This version of minesweeper allows 
custom sized boards and number of mines, flagging and unflagging spaces, and includes a timer. The number of mines remaining (total mines - flagged squares) is also calculated.
